I'm going to tear my portfolio website apart, rebuild it in AngularJS, then maybe tear it down again...

## Key goals of project
- I'm trying to learn the 'best practices' of using AngularJS and Node (fullstack)
- Trying to see what I can automate using task runners (almost everything tedious it seems) 
- Playing around with Bootstrap to see how much it can really do 
- Optimization, how can I hide the pre-loading process 
- How can I make a truly single page app and structure it correctly? 
- Testing strategies, trying to get in the Rhythm of writing unit tests for every bit of functionality.

TLDR: Learning... 

## Key Requirements 

- Some kind of 'Projects' Gallery, preferrably with a elegant way to pop up a fullscreen page with images, embeded videos, project 
details and project links 

- A basic contact form (need to see how I can set FTP up on a NodeJS backend) 

- Comments and notes 

- Potentially an admin area (authenticated access) for adding and removing project content rather than messing with JSON :P
