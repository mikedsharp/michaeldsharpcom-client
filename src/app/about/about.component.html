    Hi, I'm Mike. I write code, and...I like long walks on the beach (as long as
    I have internet access so I can write code)

  <h4>About the guy in the circle above, looking at you...</h4>
  <p>
    Hi there, my name is Mike, and I’m a software developer (currently a
    Front-end Web Developer) based in North East England.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve been writing applications, games and building websites since I was
    about 14 years old and I’m profoundly interested in technology and what
    makes those apps and sites we all use every day ‘tick’; In my mind,
    programming software is what dreams are made of, and I find building
    technical solutions to problems infinitely rewarding.

  <h4>Summary of skills</h4>
  <p>
    Please forgive me, I wrote this site in 2016 and it needs a little bit of an update!
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope I didn’t miss too much there, but I will happily answer any further
    questions if you send me a message via the form provided in the
    <a routerLink="/contact">Contact</a> section.

  <h4>When I’m not writing software I like to…</h4>
  <p>
    Travel! I’m an avid explorer, with a particular penchant for visiting places
    of architectural beauty, why only last summer I was sitting in a cafe in
    Barcelona, admiring it’s unique architecture, soaking in the atmosphere of
    it’s laid back pace and of course, enjoying it’s clement weather.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also enjoy a good book, and I’m gradually learning new languages
    (primarily Spanish, you get great service at bars and restaurants if you
    speak the lingo!). I am a fan of the finer things in life and feel blessed
    that my hobby and career allows me to attain them from time to time.
